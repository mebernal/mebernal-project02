FEEDBACK:

Excellent implementation of the parameterized findSubset() method.


-0 Why are you creating a class field called collection?
   private static ArrayList<Sublist> collection = new ArrayList<Sublist>();

   Unless you can justify it classes such as SubsetSum and BubbleSort
   that behave as function objects should not have a static or class field.
   If your implementation relies on these, then these class fields should be
   *initialized* every single time the user call the static methods.
   
   Otherwise, this results in *incorrect* results when *multiple* calls to
   SubsetSum.findSubset(...) is made.

-Bita.
